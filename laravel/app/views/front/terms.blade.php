<p><h4>How The Contract Is Formed Between You And Us</p></h4>


<p>Our site is only intended for use by people registered with us and resident in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. At our complete discretion we may accept or reject orders from people outside of these territories.</p>

<p>Your contract with us will be formed when we receive your sell order. It will incorporate these terms and conditions and our terms of use.</p>

<p>You must own all rights, title and interests in any phone(s) or tablet(s) that you send to us.</p>

<p>Ownership of the phone(s) or tablet(s) will pass to us when we receive the phone(s)/tablet(s), in accordance with these terms and conditions, and we have dispatched payment to you, when, hence, contract will be formed.</p>

<p>The contract between you and us is binding on you and us and on our respective successors and assigns.</p>

<p>You may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of a contract, or any of your rights or obligations arising under it, without our prior written consent.</p>

<p>We may transfer, assign, charge, sub-contract or otherwise dispose of a contract, or any of our rights or obligations arising under it, at any time during the term of the contract.</p>

<p>You may cancel the contract with us at any time up to the time when you send us the phone/tablet ("cooling-off period"), providing:</p>

<li>the contract was negotiated and concluded exclusively by means of distance communication (including, but not limited to, telephone, letter, fax or email); and</li>

<li>you are a natural person acting outside the purposes of any business.</li>

<br><p>When cancelling during the cooling-off period, you need not give us any reason for cancelling the contract, nor will you have to pay any administration charges.</p>

<p>To cancel the contract you must notify us in writing.</p>

<p>Other than if the phone/tablet does not meet our terms and conditions (see below), this contract cannot be cancelled after you have sent your phone(s) or tablet(s) to us (outside the "cooling-off period").</p>

<p>PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU ARE HAPPY TO SEND THE PHONE TO US AND THAT IT IS WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS TO DO SO.</p>

<li>Please ensure you remove your SIM card before sending us your mobile phone/tablet. We accept no liability in the event that a SIM card is sent with a phone/tablet and charges are then incurred.

Please use our free guide to obtain step-by-step instructions on how to delete personal data from your phone/tablet.</li>

<h4>Lost or Stolen Mobile Phones and Devices</h4>


<p>Selling a mobile phone or device which you do not own may amount to a criminal offence. Justin Mobile support and adhere to the 'Stop Stolen Mobiles Being Recycled' code of practice set by the Home Office and the National Mobile Phone Crime Unit.</p>
<p>We will check the IMEI/Serial number of all mobile phones and devices received on the CheckMEND (www.checkmend.com) database of lost and stolen property records to ensure no lost or stolen items are purchased.</p>
<p>If a mobile phone or device is found to have a record that indicates it has been lost or stolen or we become aware of any other issue relating to its ownership, we will notify the seller by email and quarantine the mobile phone or device for an initial period of 28 days ("the Quarantine Period"). Payment for the mobile phone or device will be withheld by us until the CheckMEND record does not show the mobile phone/tablet as stolen or lost.</p>
<p>In such circumstances you will be required to contact CheckMEND to prove that you are the rightful owner of the mobile phone or device and have the lost or stolen records associated with it cleared within the Quarantine Period and/or resolve any other issue relating to its ownership.</p>
<p>If during the Quarantine Period the mobile phone or device is cleared on the CheckMEND database and any other issue relating to ownership of the same is resolved, your sale will be processed and paid for as normal.</p>
<p>However, where the mobile phone or device is not cleared on CheckMEND within the Quarantine Period, we will be required by law to hold onto the mobile phone or device, pass it to the Police or other law enforcement body or dispose of it, and by entering into this contract, you expressly agree to this action. You will not receive any payment if such steps are taken.</p>
<p>UK legislation states that we cannot under any circumstances return or pay for a mobile phone or device which is lost or stolen or recorded as such.</p>
<p>If you have received payment from us for a mobile phone or device which we subsequently become aware of an issue relating to ownership, you agree to immediately reimburse us in full, within 3 business days following a written request by us, for any such payment pending an investigation by us or any law enforcement body into ownership of the device or mobile phone.</p>
<p>If we at any time become aware of any issues relating to the ownership of the mobile phone or device, you agree to co-operate with us fully with a view to resolving the issues. You may also be contacted by the Police and/or other law enforcement authorities.</p>

<h4>Pricing</h4>

<p>Prices offered on our website are subject to change at any time without notice.</p>
<p>When your order has been placed, the prices quoted are guaranteed for 14 days from the 'Order Approved' date. (This is the date on which we send you a confirmation email.) If your phone(s)/tablet(s) are received after 14 days from the 'Order Approved' date, the up-dated, current prices will apply. This could be disappointing - so to help you, we'll send a reminder email during the 14 day guarantee period.</p>

<h4>Best Price Guarantee</h4>

<p>In order for us to beat a higher offer seen elsewhere, you must provide in writing evidence of the higher offer (e.g. a link to the webpage on which the offer can be found).</p>

<p>In addition, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<li>The higher offer must be made by a registered company trading in Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and</li>
<li>Their principle trading activity must be the recycling of phones and/or tablets; and</li>
<li>The quote MUST be for a cash payment NOT a voucher payment or the like; and</li>
<li>Your phone/tablet must meet all conditions on which their quote is based</li>

<br><P>Once we have verified that these conditions have been met, we will make an adjusted offer in writing. You can accept our adjusted offer by registering your sale. Our adjusted offer is guaranteed for 14 days, or until the higher offer amount changes, or until the conditions on which the higher offer is based change, whichever comes first.</p>

<h4>Postage</h4>

<p>It is your responsibility to arrange and pay for postage of your phone/tablet to us. Unfortunately, we do not accept responsibility for non-delivery of phones/tablets or damage in transit. We therefore recommend that you send any high value units via registered post to ensure successful delivery.</p>
<p>Registered deliveries should be sent to us at:</p>
<p><b>Justin Mobile, 119 Ivy Avenue, Bath, BA2 1AW</b></p>

<h4>Payments</h4>

<p>We offer an option of cheque, bank transfer PayPal or bitcoin payments. You will be required to select a payment option when placing each online sell order. Unfortunately, this payment option cannot be changed once the order is placed.</p>

<p>When we receive your sale items, we will check that the sale is complete, and that it meets our terms and conditions. Providing it does, we will post/make payment to you, by cheque, bank transfer, PayPal or bitcoin, on the same day of receipt (Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays). Same day payment does not apply to Faulty items, sale items received after 1pm and in events that are out of our control.</p>

<h4>Cheque payments</h4>

<p>Cheque payments can only be made to the name and address given when you register.</p>
<p>If you have damaged your cheque, you can have it reissued, free of charge, by posting us a written request and including the damaged cheque to the following address:
<p><b>Justin Mobile, 119 Ivy Avenue, Bath, BA2 1AW</b></p>

<p>If the damaged cheque is not received by us, a cancelation fee will apply and will be deducted from the re-issued cheque value.</p>
<p>If you have lost your cheque, you can request for it to be cancelled and re-issued. A cancellation fee will apply and will be deducted from the re-issued cheque value.</p>

<h4>Bank Transfer payments</h4>

<p>Bank Transfer payments can only be made to the account details given when placing the online order. We cannot, under any circumstances, recall or reissue bank transfer payments once they have been made.</p>

<h4>Events Outside Of Our Control</h4>

<p>We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under a contract that is caused by events outside our reasonable control or due to our compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.</p>

<h1>About Us</h1>
<h4>Gecko Who?</h4>
<p>
	Justin Mobile was created when we realised the big mobile recyclers were offering people a raw deal. By doing things differently, we offer more money for used iPhones and iPads while making the process fast, simple and elegant. We extend the life of iPhones and iPads by refurbishing them, helping the environment!

<h4>Gecko Why?</h4>
<p>
	As well as beating the big mobile recyclers, Justin Mobile is an easier, more reliable and more transparent option than auction websites. We offer a guaranteed amount as long as the condition of your iPhone or iPad is as described. You won't find any PayPal, Listing or Final Value fees here. What you see is what you get!

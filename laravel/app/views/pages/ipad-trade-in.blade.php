<h1>iPad Trade In</h1>

<p>Are you looking to trade in your old iPad for cash? Do you want the most money for your old iPad with the least possible hassle? Then a dedicated <a href=https://www.geckomobilerecycling.co.uk/sell/ipad>iPad trade in</a> service like ours may be for you.</p>

<h2>Advantages of iPad trade in</h2>

<p>One of the main advantages of using an iPad trade in service is convenience. Selling an iPad can be stressful and time consuming. Mobile recycling services take the hassle out of selling your unwanted iPad by making the process quick, simple and stress-free. Here are just a few ways Justin Mobile Recycling make trading in your old iPad a breeze...</p>

<p><b>Price Promise</b>. We promise you'll get the price quoted, or your iPad returned for free! Other recyclers offer unrealistically high prices. They do this knowing full well they'll mark down the value of your iPad once it arrives, whatever its condition. Some even charge for returns or leave you waiting for weeks to get your precious iPad back! We think that's totally unfair so we don't do it. If you ask us to send your iPad back, we'll typically return it the same day you ask.</p>

<p><b>Tracked Freepost</b>. We don't want you shelling out any money; we want to pay <i>you</i>! You can track your iPad every step of the way on the Royal Mail website, and once it arrives at our office we'll send you an email straight away (and a text if you left a mobile number ). We don't want to leave you hanging in the dark wondering what's happening to your iPad.</p>

<p><b>Same Day Pay</b>. It's pretty exciting checking your bank account and seeing a nice big wad of cash has been deposited. We don't want to delay that experience, so we pay you the same day your iPad arrives. As soon as the money has been transferred we will let you know so you can get spending (or saving if you're that way inclined!). If you post today using our freepost label, you could have that money in your account tomorrow!</p>

<p>That's just a flavour what we have to offer. There are many more <a href=https://www.geckomobilerecycling.co.uk/why-use-us/>reasons to use us</a>.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of iPad trade in</h2>

<p>With lots of people offering you cash for your iPad it can be hard to know who to choose or who to trust. That is why you should check out their reviews (I know we keep on going on about this, but it really is important, as it's not <i>all</i> about the amount of money quoted - it's about the level of service also). Imagine something going wrong and you not being able to contact the company! You can pick up the phone any time and get straight through to us if you have a question or require <a href=https://www.geckomobilerecycling.co.uk/contact>support</a>.</p>

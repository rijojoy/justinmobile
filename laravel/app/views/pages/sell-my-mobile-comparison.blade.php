<h1>Sell my mobile comparison</h1>

<p>If you want to sell your mobile to a recycler, there are lots of things to consider. Here are 5 things to compare.</p>

<h2>1) Price</h2>

<p>Price is important, as long as it is balanced with the other factors below. Beware of unscrupulous recyclers who will lure you in with an inflated offer, just to reduce it once your mobile arrives.</p> 

<h2>2) Speed of payment</h2>

<p>You don't want to be waiting weeks to be paid when recyclers such as ourselves offer instant payment via bank transfer or PayPal the same day your mobile arrives. If you're really in a rush for that cash, another thing to consider is the time it will take for your mobile to reach the recycler. Unlike many other recyclers Justin Mobile Recycling allows you to print a 1st class pre-paid postage label, so the money could be in your account as soon as tomorrow!</p>

<h2>3) Reviews</h2>

<p>A recycler might promise something, but not deliver. This goes for the price offered and the speed of payment, among other things. When comparing mobile recycling services, positive online reviews are the best way to ensure that the company you choose delivery. As reviews can be easily fabricated, it is important to only trust reviews found on an independent review website such as TrustPilot.</p>

<h2>4) Contact number</h2>

<p>Should things go wrong, talking to a 'real person' can be the best way to have the problem resolved quickly and to your satisfaction. However, not all mobile recycling services have a contact number, and if they do, it is unmanned and you are forced to leave a message (assuming voicemail is enabled, that is). When comparing companies to sell your mobile to, it might be worth ensuring your chosen service has a phone number. Giving it a ring will allow you to make sure someone is on the other side.</p>

<h2>5) Physical address</h2>

<p>Similar to the point above, it is worth making sure your precious mobile is being sent off to a physical address and not simply a PO Box or 'virtual mailing address'. Google Street View can help you here. After all, you want to be able to turn up in person if necessary if the worst happens and your mobile disappears!</p>

<p>If I went to <a href="https://www.geckomobilerecycling.co.uk/sell-my-mobile">sell my mobile</a> I would definitely take the above 5 points into consideration when comparing mobile recycling companies.</p>
